# IKE DeX Record Ingestion Standards

## Purpose

Augments `IKE-INGEST.md` for one source type: the FDA **510(k)
Substantial Equivalence Determination Decision Summary**
(reference format: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K031739.pdf).
Such a document is ingested as a single, whole-document record (a
*DeX record*) named after its 510(k) number.

Everything not stated here is governed by `IKE-INGEST.md` § "External
Source Ingestion": prerequisites, project structure, the
`semantic-linebreak` tool, provenance attributes, the mandatory
confirmation step, validation, and the assembly exclusion rule. This
document lists only the differences.

## Detection (new step, before Step 1)

Apply this standard only when all three signals are on the first page
of the source:

1. The heading `510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION`
   (case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant).
2. The heading `DECISION SUMMARY`, usually followed by a template name
   (`DEVICE AND INSTRUMENT TEMPLATE`, `ASSAY AND INSTRUMENT COMBINATION
   TEMPLATE`, `ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE`).
3. A field `A. 510(k) Number:` whose value matches `K\d{6}`. This value
   is the *510(k) number*.

Any signal missing: not a DeX record. Use `IKE-INGEST.md` unchanged.
Do not apply the DeX shape to other FDA documents (510(k) summaries,
clearance letters, De Novo or PMA decisions).

## Differences from IKE-INGEST

| Concern | IKE-INGEST (external source) | IKE-DEX-INGEST |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Decomposition | Split into topics, 500–5000 chars | **None.** One record, whole document, size bounds exempt (note in registry, as for dialogs) |
| Source type | Classified per confirmation step | Fixed: regulatory, US federal, public domain, verbatim |
| Domain | `ext` | `dex` |
| Directory | `topics/ext/regulatory/` | `topics/dex/` |
| File name | `{slug}.adoc` | `DeXRecord_{510k-number}.adoc`, e.g. `DeXRecord_K031739.adoc` |
| Title | Descriptive | `DeXRecord_{510k-number}` |
| Topic ID | `ext-{slug}` | `dex-{510k-number lowercase}`, e.g. `dex-k031739` (registry requires lowercase kebab-case; derived from the file name) |
| Editorial context paragraph | Added for navigation | **Not added.** The registry `summary` is the abstract |
| Index terms | 3–10 | 5–15, at first substantive mention |
| Uniqueness | Redundancy check against registry | **One record per 510(k) number.** Existing `dex-{number}`: stop and ask before replacing |
| `index.adoc` heading | `== External Sources: Regulatory` | `== DeX Records` |
| Citation | Bibliographic | Same, plus the `accessdata.fda.gov` PDF URL |

### Section map

Preserve the FDA template's lettered sections in source order, with
letters and titles verbatim, as level-2 headings. Numbered sub-fields
become `[discrete]` level-3 headings or labeled list items. Do not
merge, reorder, rename, or add sections. The Device and Instrument
Template carries A–P:

```
A. 510(k) Number                         I. Substantial Equivalence Information
B. Analyte                               J. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced
C. Type of Test                          K. Test Principle
D. Applicant                             L. Performance Characteristics
E. Proprietary and Established Names     M. Instrument Name
F. Regulatory Information                N. System Descriptions
G. Intended Use                          O. Other Supportive Instrument Performance
H. Device Description                    P. Conclusion
```

Other templates carry a subset or variant; keep whatever the source has.
Tables are reproduced as AsciiDoc tables with the source's column
headings. Checkbox forms render as `Yes (X) or No ( )` with a comment
noting the original marking. Fix PDF extraction artifacts (broken
words, glyph substitutions, `Page 2 of 8` headers) only; never correct
FDA wording, spelling, or grammar.

### Header block

```asciidoc
// dex-k031739
// Topic: DeXRecord_K031739
// Type: reference
// Status: review
:topic-id: dex-k031739
:topic-type: reference
:topic-status: review
:topic-keywords: 510(k), K031739, {analyte}, {device}, substantial equivalence, {product code}
:topic-scope-note: Whole-document DeX record for K031739. Not decomposed.
:topic-provenance: external
:topic-citation: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 510(k) Substantial Equivalence Determination Decision Summary, {Template Name}: K031739, {Device Name}. Applicant: {Applicant}. https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K031739.pdf
:topic-license: Public domain — US federal government work.

[[dex-k031739]]
= DeXRecord_K031739

// Editorial: all content below is verbatim from the FDA decision summary.

== A. 510(k) Number
```

### Registry domain

Create once, then append one topic per record:

```yaml
  - id: dex
    title: "DeX Records"
    description: >
      Whole-document FDA 510(k) Substantial Equivalence Determination
      Decision Summaries, one record per 510(k) number. Never decomposed;
      never included in assemblies.
    topics:
      - id: dex-k031739
        file: topics/dex/DeXRecord_K031739.adoc
        title: "DeXRecord_K031739"
        type: reference
        status: review
        related: [ext-fda-k031739-device-overview, ext-fda-k031739-performance, ext-fda-k031739-instrument-system]
        notes: >
          DeX record — whole document, verbatim, exempt from size bounds
          per IKE-DEX-INGEST. Public domain US federal work.
```

Decomposed topics for the same 510(k) number may coexist. Link them
both ways through `related:`.

### Confirmation text

Pre-fill the `IKE-INGEST.md` mandatory confirmation:

> Detected a **510(k) Decision Summary** ({Template Name}) for
> **K031739**, {Device Name}, applicant {Applicant}.
> Handling: verbatim, whole document, one record —
> `topics/dex/DeXRecord_K031739.adoc`, topic ID `dex-k031739`.
> License: `Public domain — US federal government work.`
>
> Proceed?

### Added validation checks

- Every lettered section of the source appears once, in order.
- No page headers, footers, or extraction artifacts remain.
- File name, title, and topic ID agree with the 510(k) number.

## Instructing Claude

> Ingest this document into {target-project} per IKE-DEX-INGEST.

Claude runs Detection first. On failure it says so and proceeds under
`IKE-INGEST.md`. On success it follows `IKE-INGEST.md` § "External
source ingestion workflow" with the substitutions in this document.
